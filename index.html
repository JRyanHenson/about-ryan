		<p><h2>All about Ray Ray :</h2></p>
		<p>My name is Ryan I usually go by Ray Ray. I love opera and singing in the rain. I'm an IT guy living la vida loca in the 505 but would love to move to Ireland to roll though the green hills.
			 I enjoy hiking, pirouettes, and UFC fighting (see my fighting name above) and generally being away from real bears and strange people.</p>
		<p><h2>More me time:</h2></p>
		<p>I'm currently enrolled in a web development program and super sick of staring at computer screens. I may seek a new career in cat grooming if my UFC career doesn't pan out.</p>
		<p><h2>And finally here are a few pics of me:</h2></p>
